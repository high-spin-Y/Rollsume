**Postdoctoral: X-ray Crystallography**
*June 2024 - February 2025*

- Troubleshooted and expressed recombinant tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) from E. coli
- Screened and generated TDO & IDO crystals with 8 metabolites under anaerobic conditions
- Conducted X-ray crystallography measurements for metabolites binded TDO/IDO crystals; analyzed X-ray diffraction data with CCP4i2
- Applied UV-Vis spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques to study TDO/IDO enzyme kinetics
- Implemented AlphaFold3 and Schrodinger Maestro for TDO/IDO metabolites binding studies within a week
