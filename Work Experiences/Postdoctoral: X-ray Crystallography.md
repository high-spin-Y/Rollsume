- Expressed and purified recombinant tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) from E. coli expression systems
- Achieved high-resolution protein crystal structures (1.88 Å for TDO and 2.45 Å for IDO) with 8 different metabolites under areobic and anaerobic conditions through systematic optimization of crystallization conditions. 
- Collected X-ray diffraction data from synchrotron facilities at Brookhaven NSLS2 and SLAC-SSRL beamlines.
- Deployed AlphaFold 3 locally for custom metabolite-protein binding predictions as one of the early adopters of this technology for personalized small molecule docking
- Decreased experimental screening expense by crystal structure prediction with AlphaFold 3. 
- Discovered evidence that suggesting tryptophan activation may play a role in the previously uncharacterized ferric state TDO-tryptophan reaction mechanism through UV-Vis spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques

- Correlated structural insights from crystallography with enzyme kinetics data to advance understanding of how metabolites influence TDO/IDO activity

- ###saved time for crystal screening, and saved money by AF3 predictions. How much time and money? needs to clarify. Expected saving.
