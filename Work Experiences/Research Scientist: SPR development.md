**Research Scientist: SPR development**
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*
*August 2018 - June 2023*

- Developed molecular-unique absorption/scattering model of SEIRA, SERS, and SEF spectroscopies based on classical electromagnetism; simulated enhancement factor within 8.8% error compared to experimental
- Designed experiments for laser excited molecular Raman/IR signal enhancement by SPR/LSPR of noble metal and CdO semiconductor with polymer coating
- Applied IR-VASE to characterize SPR of the CdO semiconductor
- Built HPC environments for the group, provided Python and Bash scripts for automatic file formatting and job submission
