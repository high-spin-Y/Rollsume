    \item Increased 400\% efficiency by developed a automatic transition state structures searching and optimization from resting states with scripts in Linux Bash shell, AWK, and Python.
    \item Built and configured a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for the research group in only two weeks, including hardware integration, Torque-Maui job queue structure implementation, and development of efficient job submission scripts.
    \item Revealed mechanistic insights e.g. ring strain, steric repulsion, orbital interactions that explained experimental observations of regioselectivity in nickel-catalyzed organic reactions. 
    \item Findings subsequently cited by 100+ publications that validated the proposed mechanisms.
