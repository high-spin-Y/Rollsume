- Expressed and purified recombinant tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) from E. coli expression systems
- Achieved high-resolution protein crystal structures (1.88 Å for TDO and 2.45 Å for IDO) with 8 different metabolites under areobic and anaerobic conditions through systematic optimization of crystallization conditions. 
- Collected X-ray diffraction data from synchrotron facilities at Brookhaven NSLS2 and SLAC-SSRL beamlines.
- Deployed AlphaFold 3 locally for custom metabolite-protein binding predictions as one of the early adopters of this technology for personalized small molecule docking
- Integrated computational predictions with experimental crystallography by using Schrodinger Maestro for structural refinement and validation of AlphaFold 3 models
- Applied UV-Vis spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques to measure N-formylkynurenine formation kinetics, uncovering batch-dependent variations in tryptophan reactivity with ferric state TDO
- Discovered evidence suggesting tryptophan activation may play a role in the previously uncharacterized ferric state TDO-tryptophan reaction mechanism
- Correlated structural insights from crystallography with enzyme kinetics data to advance understanding of how metabolites influence TDO/IDO activity
