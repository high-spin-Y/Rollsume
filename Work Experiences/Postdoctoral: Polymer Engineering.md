- Modified copolyester surface achieved 80% decrease in volume removal by nanoindentationscratch testing compared to commercial copolyesters. 
- Applied LAMMPS molecular dynamics with PCFF to simulate nanoindentation processes. 
- Identified chloroform asymmetric bending mode in chloroform treated copolyester using IR-ATR and DFT computation, improved spectroscopic understanding of solvent induced crystallinity.
- Decreased 95% expense by replacing nanoindentation with modified Martindale abrasion test for polymer plates.

- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
