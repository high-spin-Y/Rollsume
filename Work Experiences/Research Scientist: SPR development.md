**Research Scientist: SPR development**
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*
*August 2018 - June 2023*

- Built a groundbreaking Classical Correlation Model (CCM) for surface-enhanced spectroscopies (SEIRA, SERS, SEF) that uniquely integrates molecular information with Maxwell equations, addressing fundamental limitations in conventional electromagnetic models
- Developed a force-based theoretical approach that matches quantum mechanical Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac calculations for resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided new insights into molecular-plasmon interactions
- Achieved remarkable accuracy with simulations matching experimental enhancement factors to within 8.8% error, as validated in Journal of Physical Chemistry A publications (2020, 2022), modelled complex phase behavior in Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy
- Designed and executed comprehensive experiments for molecular spectroscopy enhancement, including laser-excited Raman/IR signal enhancement using SPR/LSPR of noble metals and CdO semiconductor with polymer coating, and characterized the SPR properties using IR-VASE spectroscopic techniques
- Independently developed comprehensive computational infrastructure by building HPC environments and creating Python/Bash automation scripts for efficient file formatting and job submission
- 
- Led this innovative theoretical modeling project autonomously, managing all aspects from conceptualization to experimental validation and publication of multiple peer-reviewed papers
