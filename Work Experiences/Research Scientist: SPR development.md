**Research Scientist: SPR development**
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*
*August 2018 - June 2023*

- Integrated analyte information in electromagnetic models for surface-enhanced spectroscopies (SEIRA, SERS, SEF), overcame fundamental limitations in conventional models.
- Developed a force-based theoretical approach that matches quantum mechanical Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac calculations for resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided new insights into molecular-plasmon interactions.
- Achieved 91.2% accuracy with simulations matching experimental enhancement factors and modelled complex phase behavior in Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy.
- Designed and executed laser-excited Raman/IR signal enhancement using SPR/LSPR of noble metals and CdO semiconductor, characterized the SPR properties using IR-VASE spectroscopic techniques.
- Saved 90% efforts with Python/Bash automation scripts for file formatting and job submission in HPC. 
- 
- Led this innovative theoretical modeling project autonomously, managing all aspects from conceptualization to experimental validation and publication of multiple peer-reviewed papers
