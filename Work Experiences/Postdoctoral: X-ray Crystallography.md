- Expressed and purified recombinant tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) from _E. coli_. 
- Achieved high-resolution protein crystal structures (TDO 1.88 Å / IDO 2.45 Å) with 8 different metabolites under areobic and anaerobic conditions.
- Discovered heme degradation intermediate in TDO through protein mass-spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ MS).
- Collected X-ray diffraction data from synchrotron facilities at Brookhaven NSLS2 and SLAC-SSRL. 
- Decreased experimental screening expense with metabolite docking prediction with local deployed AlphaFold 3. 
- Discovered tryptophan activation may play a role in the previously uncharacterized ferric state TDO-tryptophan reaction mechanism through UV-Vis spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques.


- Correlated structural insights from crystallography with enzyme kinetics data to advance understanding of how metabolites influence TDO/IDO activity

- ###saved time for crystal screening, and saved money by AF3 predictions. How much time and money? needs to clarify. Expected saving.
