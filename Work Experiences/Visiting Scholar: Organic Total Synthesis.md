**Visiting Scholar: Organic Total Synthesis**
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*
*July 2015 - September 2015*

- Successfully completed the total synthesis of 2,3,12,13-tetrabromo-5-methoxy-8,8,18,18-tetramethylbacteriochlorin within a compressed 3-week timeframe, employing a diverse range of synthetic methodologies including Friedel-Crafts reactions, oxidative additions, Michael additions, and reductive cyclizations
- Gained valuable practical experience with air-sensitive chemistry techniques using Schlenk line apparatus for challenging cross-coupling reactions
- Characterized synthesized porphyrin-based auxochromes with high precision using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and manual shimming NMR techniques
- Collaborated with a senior PhD student on this imaging agent project, demonstrating adaptability and quick learning in a specialized organic synthesis environment
- Developed hands-on proficiency with multistep synthesis protocols for complex tetrapyrrole structures, a challenging class of compounds important in biological imaging applications
