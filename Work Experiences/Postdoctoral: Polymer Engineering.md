- Modified copolyester surface achieved 80% decrease in volume removal in nanoindentationscratch testing compared to commercial copolyesters. 
- Implemented LAMMPS molecular dynamics with PCFF to simulate nanoindentation processes and predict polymer mechanical properties under various conditions
- Enhanced spectroscopic understanding by using DFT computation and IR-ATR measurements to identify that a specific IR peak in the polymer spectrum corresponds to CHCl3 asymmetric bending mode, contributed new insights to vibrational band assignments
- Decreased 95% expense for abrasion testing by adapting Martindale abrasion testing for polymer plates, compared to nanoindentation
- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
