**Research Scientist: SPR development**
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*
*August 2018 - June 2023*

    \item Integrated analyte information in electromagnetic models for surface-enhanced spectroscopies (SEIRA, SERS, SEF), overcame fundamental limitations in conventional models.
    \item Developed a force-based theoretical approach that matches quantum mechanical Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac calculations for resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided new insights into molecular-plasmon interactions.
    \item Achieved 91.2\% accuracy with simulations matching experimental enhancement factors and modelled complex phase behavior in Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy.
    \item Designed and executed laser-excited Raman/IR signal enhancement using SPR/LSPR of noble metals and CdO semiconductor, characterized the SPR properties using IR-VASE spectroscopic techniques.
    \item Saved 90\% efforts with Python/Bash automation scripts for file formatting and job submission in HPC.
