- Revealed mechanistic insights e.g. ring strain, steric repulsion, orbital interactions that explained experimental observations of regioselectivity in nickel-catalyzed organic reactions. Findings subsequently cited by experimental groups that validated the proposed mechanisms.
- Accelerated computational workflow by automatically generating and optimizing transition state structures from provided resting states with automation scripts in Linux Bash shell, AWK, and Python.
- Built and configured a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for the research group in only two weeks, including hardware integration, Torque-Maui job queue structure implementation, and development of efficient job submission scripts.
