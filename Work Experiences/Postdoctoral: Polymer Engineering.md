## Postdoctoral Researcher: Polymer Engineering
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*  
*July 2023 - May 2024*

- Collaborated with Eastman Inc. to develop modified copolyesters with enhanced anti-abrasion properties, achieving an 80% decrease in volume removal compared to commercial copolyesters as measured by nanoindentation scratch testing
- Implemented LAMMPS molecular dynamics to simulate nanoindentation processes and predict polymer mechanical properties under various conditions
- Enhanced spectroscopic understanding by using DFT computation and IR-ATR measurements to identify that a specific IR peak in the polymer spectrum corresponds to CHCl3 asymmetric bending mode, contributing new insights to vibrational band assignments
- Innovated a cost-effective alternative to expensive nanoindentation by adapting Martindale abrasion testing (typically used for textiles) for polymer plate testing, including design and 3D-printing of custom sample holders
- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
