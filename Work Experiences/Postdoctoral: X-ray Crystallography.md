    \item Decreased X-ray crystallograpy screening expense by >90\% with AlphaFold 3 metabolite docking prediction
    \item  Isolated 99\% pure recombinant tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) from \textit{E. coli} using affinity, IEX, and SEC chromatography for rigorous experiment quality control
    \item Discovered 2 heme degradation intermediates in TDO through protein mass-spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ MS)
    \item Achieved top 3\% performance measuring protein crystal structures upto TDO 1.88 Å / IDO 2.45 Å using 8 different metabolites under areobic and anaerobic conditions
    \item Observed tryptophan activation in the previously uncharacterized ferric state TDO-Trp reaction mechanism through UV-Vis spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques



- Correlated structural insights from crystallography with enzyme kinetics data to advance understanding of how metabolites influence TDO/IDO activity

- ###saved time for crystal screening, and saved money by AF3 predictions. How much time and money? needs to clarify. Expected saving.
