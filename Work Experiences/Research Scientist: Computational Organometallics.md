- Led DFT computational investigations into nickel-catalyzed reactions, revealed critical mechanistic insights e.g. ring strain, steric repulsion, orbital interactions that explained experimental observations of regioselectivity in both cycloisomerization of dienes and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions, with findings subsequently cited by experimental groups validating the proposed mechanisms.
- Developed custom automation scripts in Linux shell, AWK, and Python to streamline transition state discovery, significantly accelerated computational workflow by automatically generating and optimizing transition state structures from provided resting states.
- Built and configured a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for the research group in only two weeks, including hardware integration, Torque-Maui job queue structure implementation, and development of efficient job submission scripts.
