- Achieved 80% decrease in volume removal compared to commercial copolyesters by surface modification as measured by nanoindentation scratch testing. 
- Implemented LAMMPS molecular dynamics to simulate nanoindentation processes and predict polymer mechanical properties under various conditions
- Enhanced spectroscopic understanding by using DFT computation and IR-ATR measurements to identify that a specific IR peak in the polymer spectrum corresponds to CHCl3 asymmetric bending mode, contributed new insights to vibrational band assignments
- Innovated a cost-effective alternative to expensive nanoindentation by adapting Martindale abrasion testing (typically used for textiles) for polymer plates
- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
