## Postdoctoral Researcher: Polymer Engineering
*North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC*  
*July 2023 - May 2024*

    \item  Improved 400\% strength in scratch test with synthesized novel topology polymers
    \item Programmed LAMMPS / PCFF simulating nanoindentation to guide polymer surface modification
    \item  Identified chloroform asymmetric bending mode in chloroform treated copolyester using IR-ATR and DFT computation, improved spectroscopic understanding of solvent induced crystallinity
    \item Decreased 95\% expense by replacing nanoindentation with modified Martindale abrasion test for polymer plates
    
- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
