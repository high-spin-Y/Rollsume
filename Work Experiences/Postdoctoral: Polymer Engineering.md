    \item Achieved 80\% decrease in nanoindentor scratch removal by surface modification.
    \item Applied LAMMPS molecular dynamics with PCFF to simulate nanoindentation processes.
    \item Identified chloroform asymmetric bending mode in chloroform treated copolyester using IR-ATR and DFT computation, improved spectroscopic understanding of solvent induced crystallinity.
    \item Decreased 95\% expense by replacing nanoindentation with modified Martindale abrasion test for polymer plates.

- Explored potential interdisciplinary applications connecting polymer science with SPR techniques for quantifying enzymatic degradation of abraded microplastics
